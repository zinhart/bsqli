# BSQLI
By abstracting away the mechanics of blind sqli behind wrapper functions, when writing a custom exploit we can treat the sqli portion as a sub-component of the overall exploit.  
BSQLI is a python framework for black boxing blind sqli injections in custom exploit chains.  
It features synchronous and asynchrous methods and optimized data retrieval (via binary search).  
I started this project while studying for the OSWE exam.
